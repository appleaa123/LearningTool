# Test feed content endpoint
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2024/knowledge/feed/1/content?user_id=test_user"
# Expected: Full content with metadata
```

### 1.2 Search and Filter Testing
```bash
# Test filtering by content type
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2024/knowledge/feed?user_id=test_user&filter=chunk&limit=3"
# Expected: Only chunk-type items

# Test search functionality
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2024/knowledge/feed/search?q=structured&user_id=test_user"

```

### 2.3 Verify Feed Population
```bash
# Check feed after uploads
curl "http://127.0.0.1:2024/knowledge/feed?user_id=test_user&limit=10"
# Expected: New feed items from uploaded content
```

## Phase 3: Frontend UI Validation (15 minutes)

### 3.1 Application Loading
- Navigate to http://localhost:5173/app/

### 3.3 Navigation & State Management
- Switch between Chat, Feed, and Topics views
- Verify state is preserved when switching views
- Check live count badges update correctly
- Verify responsive design at different screen sizes

### 3.4 Content Display Validation
- Verify different content types render correctly:
  - Text chunks with expand/collapse
  - Summaries with proper formatting

- Verify results highlight matching content
- Test search across different content types
- Verify search performance (results appear quickly)

### 5.2 Filter System
- Test each content type filter
- Verify filter counts update correctly
- Test combining search with filters
- Verify filter state persists during session

## Phase 6: Performance & Error Handling (5 minutes)

### 6.1 Performance Validation
- Monitor feed load times (should be <2 seconds)
- Test infinite scroll performance with multiple items
- Check memory usage during extended use
- Verify smooth scrolling at 60fps

### 6.2 Error Handling
- Test with invalid API calls
- Verify graceful error messages display
- Test retry functionality when errors occur
- Check offline/network error handling

## Success Criteria

### Must Pass 
- [ ] All API endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Feed displays uploaded content correctly
- [ ] Three-view navigation works seamlessly
- [ ] Search and filters function properly
- [ ] No console errors during normal use
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/desktop

### Should Pass 
- [ ] Topic suggestions generate from uploads
- [ ] Research pipeline integrates with feed
- [ ] Performance meets benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling is graceful
- [ ] Accessibility features work properly

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial feed load: <2 seconds
- Search response: <1 second  
- Infinite scroll: Smooth 60fps
- Memory usage: <100MB increase

## Test Execution Notes
- Use actual test materials from `/Test_Material/` folder
- Verify API keys are configured in `.env`
- Test with both empty and populated feed states
- Document any issues found for resolution
- Take screenshots of successful UI states

## Risk Areas to Monitor
- Large file uploads (performance impact)
- API rate limits with multiple uploads
- Memory usage during infinite scroll
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsive behavior

This comprehensive test plan validates the complete Facebook-style knowledge newsfeed and optional research system implementation.
