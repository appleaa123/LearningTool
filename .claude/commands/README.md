## TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES

### For You (The User):
1. **Copy this entire template** for each new requirement
2. **Fill out all relevant sections** - skip sections that don't apply
3. **Be specific** in acceptance criteria - use testable statements
4. **Include context** - help me understand the "why" behind the requirement
5. **Update status** as work progresses

### For Me (Claude):
This template provides:
- **Clear scope** and acceptance criteria for implementation
- **Technical guidance** on architecture and file structure
- **Context** for making good technical decisions
- **Success metrics** to validate correct implementation
- **Test scenarios** to ensure quality and reliability

### Priority Guidelines:
- **Critical**: System stability, security issues, blocking other work
- **High**: Core user functionality, significant business value
- **Medium**: Feature enhancements, user experience improvements
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, minor optimizations

### Estimation Guidelines:
- **1-2 hours**: Small UI tweaks, configuration changes, minor bug fixes
- **1-2 days**: New components, API endpoints, database changes
- **1-2 weeks**: Complex features, major integrations, architectural changes
